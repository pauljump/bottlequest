## What Happened This Session

### Discovery Phase
1. ✅ Started with original BottleQuest (Pokémon Go for rare items)
2. ✅ Discovered physical stores are dying; transactions moved online
3. ✅ Identified real problem: **Information asymmetry** (expert knowledge locked in 1-on-1 conversations)
4. ✅ Found insight from Nick Johnson: "Pappy 23 ($2.5k) is ordinary; Weller 107 ($100) is better"

### Concept Exploration (3 Rounds)
- **Round 1:** Generated 25 concepts → User rejected all
- **Round 2:** Generated 5 new concepts → User interested in #4 (Hype Index Futures) but rejected prediction market category
- **Round 3:** Generated 5 completely fresh concepts → User paused to come back later

## Rejected Categories (Don't Go Here)

- ❌ Prediction markets / Polymarket-style
- ❌ Gambling / betting mechanics
- ❌ Auctions (regulatory concerns)
- ❌ Pure tracking/alerts (not engaging)
- ❌ B2B-only tools

---

## Requirements (Must Have)

- ✅ AI-native infra moat (not wrapper)
- ✅ Consumer-facing
- ✅ Fun to build with role-specific tooling:
  - Tinder-like curation console
  - SQL/analytics console for ops
- ✅ Novel and untapped
- ✅ Avoid heavy regulation

## To Continue

When ready:

```bash
cd /Users/pjump/Desktop/projects/bottlequest
# Then say: continue
```

**I'll ask you to either:**
1. Pick a concept from Round 3 (or earlier rounds)
2. Propose a completely new direction
3. Generate 5 more concepts

Then we resume questioning protocol → 100% readiness → perfect prompt → build.
